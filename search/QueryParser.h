 * Author:  Julien Eychenne
 * Purpose: implement search engine
 *
 * All searches in Dolmen are implemented via an abstract query protocol, which is
 * loosely based on SQL but adapted to the needs of the program.
 * This allows queries to be easily remembered and saved, for instance to display
 * frequently used subsets of the corpus.
 * A query can search and/or return any (registered) object or attribute from a
 * file. Objects are preceded by '@' and their attributes are accessed using
 * the dot notation (e.g. @item.text --> "text of an Item object").
 *
 * Syntax:
 *    SEARCH @object FROM files WHERE data_conditions && metadata_conditions RETURN return_val;
 *
 * When there are several instances of an object (e.g. tiers, items), a specific instance
 * may be accessed by its index. The indexing system uses a 1-based array notation (e.g.
 * @item[5] --> "5th item in a tier"). If the index is 0, all objects are processed.
 *
 * The files in the FROM statement are always a list of vfiles. The user selects the files of
 * interest in the search window and the search engine only discards those that don't satisfy
 * the metadata conditions.
 *
 * The RETURN value is always a list of type return_val. Importantly, the SEARCH object and the
 * RETURN object need not be the same. A typical case is when a user wants to retrieve the value
 * of a particular attribute in an object (e.g. "get the start of the 5th span").
 * Since version 1.9.1, it directly followed by a separator between angle brackets. This is used to
 * join items in the query view. Note that space characters are replaced with "%SPACE%" so that the
 * separator can be properly parsed by the query parser.
 *
 * Example:
 *     SEARCH @tier[3] FROM vfile1, vfile2 WHERE (@item.text ~ "e141[34]") && () RETURN <%SPACE%> @item.text;

 Extensions for cross-tier search:
 - use 'x' instead of number for the @tier object to signal a cross-tier search
 - use braces {} to pass parameters to objects. For instance, "@item{1}.text" is the text of an item
 in the first tier.

since version 1.9.1, we distinguish 3 relations, indicated with a new specifier:
 - :align -> alignment, where 2 items are strictly aligned on different tiers
 - :prec   -> precedence, where 2 items follow each other on the same tier
 - :dom -> dominance, where 1 item strictly dominates another one on a different tier

The specifier precedes the AND operator in data part of a WHERE statement.

Example:
     SEARCH @tier[x] FROM ... WHERE ((@item{1}.text ~ "e141[34]") AND:align (@item{3}.text ~ "e141[34]")) && () RETURN @graphnode{4}.crosstext;
Another RETURN object: @graphnode = a node from 1 item in a tier dominating other items on another tier
Attribute: crosstext = convenience to get the concatenated text of daughter items on the display tier.
So "@graphnode{1,5}.crosstext" gets a matching item on tier 1, looks up its daughters on tier 5 and concatenates their text.
For now, @graphnode.crosstext should be used only if the 1st search tier and the display tier are different.

Example with a document:
	SEARCH @file[x]  -perl FROM %document WHERE (@document.text ~ "le") && () RETURN @document.match;
for now @file[x] represents a Document (TODO: get rid of "[x]"??). @document.text represents a Document's text property

To look for tiers by name, we use the following syntax:
SEARCH @tier[0] FROM vfile1, vfile2 WHERE (@item{$tier_name}.text ~ "e141[34]") && () RETURN @item.text;
where "tier_name" is the name of the tier, and the $ sign signals that it's a text variable, not a number.
